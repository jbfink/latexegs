	\begin{frame}
		Who am I?
	\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	What is the difference between \textit{word processing} and \textit{typesetting}?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	Why choose typesetting over (most) word processing?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The source is \textbf{portable}
		\pause
		\item Item 2
		\pause
		\item Item 3 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\note{Portable as in ascii text. There is simply no other format extant that will guarantee as much interoperability and long-term preservation as straight up text will. It can be version controlled. It can be put anywhere. It will definitely outlast me and probably you.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Worry about \textbf{content}, not (or not much) about \textbf{form}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Long term preservation	
	\end{itemize} 
	\note{Bloomsday book example? Agrippa? Or just talk about how it is about 100000x easier to do programmy-type things -- like git version control etc -- on plain text vs. some sort of weird homunculus like word}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	%insert word doing dumb thing here
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	Why choose word processing \textit{over} typesetting?
	\note{this is a note.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	What is \LaTeX{}?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	What is... TeX?
	\note{wikpedia sez: "is a typesetting system which was designed and written by Donald Knuth[1] and first released in 1978. TeX is a popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems."}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	The \textbf{structure} of a \LaTeX{} document.
	\note{a LaTeX document is *just text*. You can edit it with anything that edits plain text and doesn't mangle it, you can put it in version control, you can copy it anywhere, you can be assured that -- as plain text -- it will probably be viewable, at least as text, for the forseeable future (my lifetime, if not yours at least)}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\includegraphics[height=8cm]{latex-structure}
	\note{Let's take a look here. This is the beginning of my slide deck for this very talk -- yup, that's right, you can actually write slides in LaTeX just like any other document. First, you have the preamble -- this sets up your document. Let's go through it line by line, shall we?}

	\end{Verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
	So just about any \LaTeX{} specific markup will look like:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A \verb|\| character
		\pause
		\item A \textbf{command}, like \textit{includegraphics}
		\pause
		\item The information fed to the command, in \verb|{}|, like \verb|{imagename}|
		\pause
		\item \textbf{options} passed to the command, in \verb|[]|, like \verb|[height=8cm]|
		\pause
		\item So, the command \verb|\includegraphics{imagename}[height=8cm]| will display the image titled \textit{imagename}, scaled to 8cm height.
	\end{itemize}
	\note{Whoof! A lot to take in. Note that, in LaTeX, at least when you're inserting images, you do not specify an image extension -- e.g., no imagename.png or whatever, just imagename.}
